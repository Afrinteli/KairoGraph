from KairoGraph.graphs import create_histogram, create_scatterplot
from KairoGraph.tables import read_table, clean_data, analyze_data
from KairoGraph.geometry import Square, Rectangle, Circle

# Create a histogram of data
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
create_histogram(data)

# Create a scatter plot of x and y data
x_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y_data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
create_scatterplot(x_data, y_data)

# Read in a table of data
table = read_table("data.csv")

# Clean and filter the data
cleaned_data = clean_data(table)

# Analyze the data
analysis_results = analyze_data(cleaned_data)

# Create a square with side length 5
square = Square(5)
